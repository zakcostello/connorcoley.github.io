Iâ€™m a researcher advancing the transition of biology into an engineering discipline. My work has been published in top journals in synthetic biology and control theory, such as Nature Communications and IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. I solve challenging problems in <b>synthetic biology</b> leveraging my multidisciplinary skill set including <b>machine learning
</b>, <b>control theory</b>, <b>applied mathematics</b>, and <b>robotic automation</b>. I work at the interface of biological theory and practice so that techniques I develop are rigorously validated. Every project I undertake is in service of creating a world where any organism can be engineered predictably, rapidly, and at low cost.
